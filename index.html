					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hey my name is Lars W. I am a 4th year history transfer who enjoys any and all things history and lore related. I enjoy watching movies, playing video games, traveling, and spending quality time with my fiance√© and our 1 year old bernadoodle. With what I plan on doing with my education after I graduate is currently up in the air, but recently I have been toying with the idea of maybe using my degree to enter the lawyering world. </p>
