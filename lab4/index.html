					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to get us to understand and do some psuedocoding, and then add the pseudo code into our html from the javascript. This is seen below for the pseudocoding of a game of tic-tac-toe.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I don't feel as if there were really any problems, but I do feel mildly confused as to whether I did the lab correctly. It seemed rather vague what I was supposed to do or where I was supposed to put the psuedocode within the html. My biggest problem was merely trying to figure out what I was supposed to do, and I feel that I'll figure it out when I get my grade back. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall as I'm finishing up this assignment, I feel still rather confused about whether I'm missing something as I finish up here. I am going with my gut and seeing how this plays out.</p>

						// Lab 4 - Pseudocode to JavaScript
// Tic-Tac_Toe
// An implementation of the game
// Author: Lars Widman <lpwidman@ucsc.edu>
// April 2024

// Example: Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game
// 1. Print the board before each turn
//     // Loop through each row
//         // Loop through each space
//             // Print X, O, or Space
//             // Print a | between
//         // Print a newline at the end
//         // Print a horizontal line between
// 2. Accept user input
// 3. Validate user move
// 4. Evaluate possible moves
// 5. Choose computer move
// 6. Test for win or draw condition
