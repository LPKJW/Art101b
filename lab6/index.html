			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we were tasked with experimenting with Arrays and applying them to the javascript vehicle that we used in Lab 5.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When working with the html I struggled with getting the javascript to go through and show up on the website, after copy/pasting my solution from the last lab though it all worked out. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab wasn't as difficult as some of the other labs when we were starting off. It seems more like were building up to something bigger as we go but at the moment I am feeling comfortable with the information we've learned so far.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The Javascript is presented bellow with an updated script</p>
