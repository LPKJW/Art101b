			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we were tasked with experimenting with Functions and applying them to a javascript name tag that is supposed to create an anagram of the name we put into the prompt.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When working with the html I struggled with getting the javascript to go through and show up on the website, asked wesbot for some advice and he hooked me up. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>For this lab it felt a bit more difficult than the last, I was trying to figure out why it wasn't working and I found that I had accidentally not capitalized one of the variables, feels bad man.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The Javascript is presented bellow with an updated script</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
