                <p>
Our records show that you have received one or more loans. Your school 
requires that you complete an exit interview session, either in-person 
or
electronically. If you proceed, you will complete your exit interview 
electronically. This can be a great convenience since you do <strong>not</strong>
 need to print, sign, or return any forms.
While you must complete this exit interview, you need not complete it 
electronically. Your notification letter describes the other methods 
available to you.
</p>
<p>You need the following to complete an on-line exit interview:
</p><ol>
 <li>One of the most recent two versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
 </li><li>You must not have images disabled. If you cannot see this <img alt="One Dot" src="Exit%20Interview%20History_files/reddot.gif" width="8" height="8"> red dot, you will need to enable images.</li>
 <li>Enabling JavaScript is recommended but not required.</li>
 <li>Certain documents and forms will require the Adobe Acrobat Reader. If you need a copy of the Acrobat Reader, you can <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" target="_blank">download it for free</a> from Adobe.</li>
</ol>
<p>
You will be requested to answer a series of questions at the start of 
the interview to demonstrate your understanding of the materials. You 
can not complete the interview until you have correctly answered
the questions. If you can not successfully complete the questions, you 
will need to contact your loan office.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the exit interview is to inform you of your rights and 
responsibilities based on the financial aid you accepted from your 
institution. The information presented during the interview
is a summary of the information contained on the promissory note(s) you 
signed for financial aid. The promissory note is the binding obligation 
between you and your institution.
We suggest that you review your promissory note(s) carefully in order to
 become familiar with all of the features and duties. Also, your 
promissory note will
describe any deferment and cancellation privileges (more later).
</p>
<p>
You may print the pages of this exit interview as you moved through the 
process.  You can also retrieve this information when logging in to your
 account online.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Important Note!</strong> Your institution reserves the right to 
reject any on-line exit interview due to missing or unacceptable 
responses. Please carefully provide correct <em>and</em> complete information.
